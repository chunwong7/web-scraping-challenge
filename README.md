# web-scraping-challenge
push the scrape buttom to scrape information about mars from various site and display them on the html
the css still needs work, the mars feature image differ in size each time so at times, the image might overlap into the mars fact section
scrape function is writting in a separate python file
each time the scrape button is pushed, the previous set of data stored in mongo is removed and replaced with the newly scraped data
